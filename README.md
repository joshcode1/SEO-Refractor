## User Story
* As a web-developer, I want to easily navigate through code with everything being named the right elements.

## Description 
* The Website it self what created perfectly on the user's side but when it came to what the code looked like everything looked the same. So I changed what the code looked like by getting rid of unnecessary "Div" elements and replacing them without changing what the website looks like.

## The Goal
* I wanted to change all the div elements into the correct elements so it's easier for the programmer to navigate through the code.
